# Install notes for DYODE

## Hardware setup
DYODE is composed of two hardware types:
* 2 x  Computers (for example Raspberry Pis)
* 3 x Copper/Optical converters (TP-LINK MC100CM for example)
* Additional NICs (3 per computer are needed)
* 2 optical cables
* Some RJ-45 cables

## Software setup
DYODE is developed in Python and heavily relies on open-source libraries.

From the top of the repository, run the installer. It installs
[udpcast](https://www.udpcast.linux.lu/) (the tool that moves files through the
diode), Python 3.11+ virtualenv support and DYODE's Python packages, then starts
the setup wizard:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --offline   # air-gapped: uses only the files in packaging/
sudo ./install.sh --online    # with internet access
```

With neither flag it asks. Offline installs need no network at all; the
bundle covers Ubuntu 24.04 and 26.04 (amd64, arm64) and 64-bit
Raspberry Pi OS 12 and 13. See
`PYTHON3_MIGRATION.md` at the root of the repository for details.

### Configuration file
Configuration is based on a YAML file, which must be copied to both input and output diodes.

The quickest way to produce one is the wizard at the root of the repository:
`python3 dyode_setup.py`. It fills in the interface names and MAC addresses for you.
The rest of this section describes the file it writes.

A complete, commented example is in `config.example.yaml`. Below is a shorter one
```yaml
config_name: "Dyode test"
config_version : 1.0
config_date: 2016-05-04

dyode_in:
  ip: 10.0.1.1
  mac: b8:27:eb:89:1e:f3
dyode_out:
  ip: 10.0.1.2
  mac: b8:27:eb:b1:ff:ab

modules:
  "Partage de fichier 1":
     type: folder
     port: 9600
     in: /home/pi/in
     out: /home/pi/out
  "Partage 2":
     type: folder
     port: 9700
     in: /home/pi/in2
     out: /home/pi/out2
  "Automate Modbus 1":
     type: Modbus
     port: 9400
     ip: 192.168.1.150
     port_out: 502
     registers:
       - 0-100
       - 400-450
     coils:
       - 0-10
       - 100-110
  "Automate Modbus 2":
    type: modbus
    port: 9500
    ip: 127.0.0.1
    port_out: 503
    registers:
      - 0-10
      - 400-402
    coils:
      - 0-10
      - 100-110
  "Partage d'ecran presta":
     type: screen
     port: 9900
     in: /home/pi/screenz
     out: /home/pi/screenz
```
It's supposed to be straight-forward.
Each entry is defined by its type (folder, Modbus or screen), and some properties:
* port is the base port used to send the data (by udpcast for folders, by UDP sockets for modbus and screen)
* in is the path of the folder on the input diode where the files to be transfered are located
* out is the path on the output diode where the received files will be stored
* for modbus, you need to specify the coils and registers range that you want to transfer. Ranges exclude the end: `0-100` means addresses 0 to 99


Copy all files in the two computers. To launch the diode, launch :
* dyode_in.py on the input computer
* dyode_out.py on the output computer

## Logs

Both boxes write to `/var/log/dyode-transfer`: `dyode.log` for reading, and
`transfer.jsonl` for monitoring tools (one JSON object per line, with the
file and byte counts per batch). Everything still goes to stderr as well, so
`journalctl -u dyode-in -f` works as before.

Install rotation once per box — daily rotation, packed into a weekly tarball:

```bash
sudo cp ../packaging/logrotate/dyode-transfer /etc/logrotate.d/
sudo cp ../packaging/systemd/dyode-log-archive.* /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now dyode-log-archive.timer
```

Edit `ExecStart` in `dyode-log-archive.service` if DYODE is not installed in
`/opt/dyode`. Log files are owned `root:adm`, so a monitoring agent needs to
be in the `adm` group. See PYTHON3_MIGRATION.md for the event schema and the
`logging:` config keys.
